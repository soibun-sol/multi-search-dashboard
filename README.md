## User Stories
AS A user of multiple search engines
WHEN I open my brower and see my homepage
THEN I see a list of search engines and useful links that I commonly visit, with other
information I might find helpful, laid out in a way that is visually pleasing.
IT IS DONE WHEN I:
- load the page and see a list of useful links
- have a way to toggle between light and dark modes for the site
- save my theme in local settings, so it is stored for next time
- see the current weather when i enter my location
- save my city search location in local settings, so it is stored for next time
-
STRETCH GOALS:
- have the background image represent that weather
